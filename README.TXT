From your shell, while in this (physion/trunk) directory, run the
command:

./bandt

The above script simply sets the CLASSPATH to "src", compiles the .java
files, and then runs the class TestEBuilder.

The directory "src" and its subdirectories contain all the source code needed.
The directory "gui" contains test files that have nothing to do with running
the TestEBuilder program.
