There are three ways to install/distribute datetimepicker.jar. Look into
all three of them and then decide which is best for you.

Method 1: Include this jar file in your classpath.
    You can copy this jar file under any directory
    and include the jar file in your class path. 
    E.g.
        java -classpath "MyApp/myapp.jar;installdir/datetimepicker.jar" MyApp

Method 2: Jar this along with your classes 
    You can unjar this file under your classes directory and jar 
    the classes along with your class files into a single .jar file.
    This is best suited for Applet.

    E.g.
        cd MyApp/classes
        jar xvf datetimepicker.jar
        jar cvf MyApp.jar com myapp

Method 3: Install the jar file in the Java Runtime Extension Directory.

    Copy the datetimepicker.jar to the jre/lib/ext directory. 
    Java by default includes all .jar file under jre/lib/ext directory
    in its classpath, so you don't have to include the .jar file
    in the classpath when you compile or run an application. 
    This won't work for applet, since you can't install the file on 
    client machine's jre/lib/ext directory. This is best when you
    distrubute the jre along with your application.

NetBeans Installation (Only for Version 2.0 and above)

and select "Swing" palette.
