===== Compound Row ALL COUNT =====
Original RowData:
Epoch | All
  Epoch | responses All have Any
    Response | resources Count <= "5"
Test Translation: 
Starting With RowData:
Epoch | All
  Epoch | responses All have Any
    Response | resources Count <= "5"
RowData Translated To Expression:
CUQ: Epoch
rootExpression:
OperatorExpression(and)
  OperatorExpression(all)
    AttributeExpression(responses)
    OperatorExpression(or)
      OperatorExpression(<=)
        OperatorExpression(count)
          AttributeExpression(resources)
        Int32LiteralValueExpression(5)
ExpressionTree Translated Back To RowData:
